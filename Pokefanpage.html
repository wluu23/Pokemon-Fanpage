<h2 class="heading"><a id="section1"> The History of Pokemon </a></h2>
<p>
<p class="info1">Pokemon is a media franchise created by <span style="font-size: 105%; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"> Satoshi Tajiri</span> in 1995. Many of us probably grew up with these creatures, as we have been exposed
to them in many ways. The basis of the story is that humans, called Pokemon Trainers, catch and train Pokemon creatures 
in order to have them battle each other
<p class="info1"> Pokemon started off as video games for the Game Boy console, but its popularity allowed it
to expand to trading cards, television shows and movies. Most recently, there was a huge fad over the smartphone app, 
Pokemon Go, which allowed people to act as Pokemon Trainers, using their very own cellular device. If you haven't experienced Pokemon yet,
give it a shot! <span style="font-size: 105%; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold">Warning</span>: The games can get very addicting.
